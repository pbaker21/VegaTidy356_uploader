Hi Will,

Vegatidy update:

I've added a table to `vegastats_test` on our server (also on my machine too). The table looks like:



The only way I can think of linking the tag id information to the order is via a full photo name, for example: camprefix = 'TTH' AND imagenumber = '0003' AND bgnumber = '5555' 
The only other way I can think of is, adding another field `tag_id` to vega's `purchased_items` table, which would then pass the tag_id from `incoming_photos` to `purchased_items` on a purchase.
